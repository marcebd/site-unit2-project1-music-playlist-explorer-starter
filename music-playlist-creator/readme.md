### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

The lab sessions were instrumental in laying the groundwork for HTML, CSS, and the basics of JavaScript, which helped me to start building the project with a solid foundation. However, I felt somewhat unprepared for implementing JavaScript events, as they were only briefly touched upon during the labs. This gap meant I had to seek additional resources to understand how to effectively integrate interactive elements into my project, which was both challenging and time-consuming.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.

With more time, I would have explored and implemented the stretch features that were outlined in the project specs. One major addition would have been integrating the Spotify API to not only display song titles but also to allow users to play previews of the songs directly from the webpage. This feature would have significantly enhanced the user experience by making the interface more interactive and engaging. Additionally, I would have refined the responsiveness of the webpage to various user interactions, ensuring a smoother and more intuitive user experience.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

The project demo went relatively well, with positive feedback on the layout and design of the webpage. However, there were a few hiccups with some JavaScript functionalities not responding as expected during the demo, which highlighted the need for more thorough testing in future projects. Observing my peer, Timothie, I was particularly impressed with the implementation of a user sign-in feature, which not only personalized the experience but also allowed for tracking user preferences and history. This is something I would like to incorporate into my next project. Additionally, Timothie's use of vibrant and well-coordinated color schemes provided a visually appealing interface that I aim to emulate and further enhance in my future work.
